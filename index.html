<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
The emergence of the new Data Science discipline was triggered to a large extent by the growing popularity, and commercial success, of the Web, social networks, and algorithmic recommendation systems. The success of these applications is due to extensive use of unsupervised learning. This course will cover the specialized data structures and algorithms that were developed for these applications.

<h1>General Policy</h1>


<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
Our intent is that this course provide a welcoming environment for all students who satisfy the prerequisites. Our TAs have undergone training in diversity and inclusion, and all members of the CS community, including faculty and staff, are expected to treat one another in a professional manner. If you feel you have not been treated in a professional manner by any of the course staff, please contact any of Dan (the instructor), Ugur Cetintemel (Dept. Chair), Tom Doeppner (Vice Chair) or Laura Dobler (diversity and inclusion staff member). We will take all complaints about unprofessional behavior seriously. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let James know of ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

To access student support services and resources, and to learn more about diversity and inclusion in CS, please visit <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/resources/">http://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/resources/</a>.
</p>

<p class="hyphenate">
Prof. Krishnamurthi has <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2016/professionalism.html">good notes</a> on this area.
</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity, Collaboration, and Citation</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
Feel free to talk to your friends about the concepts in the projects, and work through the ideas behind problems together, but be sure to always write your own code and perform your own write up. You are expected to implement the core components of each project on your own, but the extra credit opportunties often build on third party data sets or code. Feel free to include results built on other software, as long as you credit correctly in your handin and clearly demark your own work. In general, if you use an idea, text, or code from elsewhere, then cite it.
</p>
<p class="hyphenate">
Brown-wide, academic dishonesty is not tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/orientation/academic-student-conduct-codes">Brown Academic and Student Conduct Codes</a>.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Please inform me if you have a disability or other condition that might require accommodations or modification of any of these course procedures. You may email me, come to office hours, or speak with me after class, and your confidentiality is respected. We will do whatever we can to support accommodations recommended by SEAS. For more information contact <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/accessibility-services/">Student and Employee Accessibility Services (SEAS)</a> at 401-863-9588 or <script type="text/javascript">hiddenemail('brown.edu','SEAS')</script><noscript>Enable Javascript to see the email address</noscript>. Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact one of the deans in the Dean of the College office.
</p>

<h2>Mental Health</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
Being a student can be very stressful. If you feel you are under too much pressure or there are psychological issues that are keeping you from performing well at Brown, we encourage you to contact <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/counseling-and-psychological-services/">Brown's Counseling and Psychological Services</a>. They provide confidential counseling and can provide notes supporting extensions on assignments for health reasons.
</p>

<h2>Incomplete Policy</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
We expect everyone to complete the course on time. However, we certainly understand that there may be factors beyond your control, such as health problems and family crises, that prevent you from finishing the course on time. If you feel you cannot complete the course on time, please discuss with the Professors the possibility of being given a grade of Incomplete for the course and setting a schedule for completing the course in the upcoming year.
</p>
