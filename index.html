<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
    Data Science is an exciting and new discipline that has begun to emerge
    around data and computation. Traditionally, statistics has been focused on
    understanding and modeling data, and computer science has been focused on
    algorithms and efficient computation. Data Scientists use both fields, as
    well as domain-specific knowledge, to gain insight, build models and design
    systems for making decisions that are in part data driven.
</p>
<p class="hyphenate">
    DATA1030, Introduction to Topics in Data and Computational Science, is a
    double-credit course, that contains three threads of instruction. The first
    is designed to give students hands-on experience with some of the applied
    statistical concepts, and software tools that are essential for modern data
    science. Gathering data, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and
    machine learning are all part of this aspect part of the course.
</p>
<p class="hyphenate">

    The second thread is a review of many of the Algorithms and Data Structures
    that one would typically encounter in an Undergraduate Computer Science
    program. The approach here is also hands-on with short presentations of
    theoretical material followed by many coding problems and questions. The
    goal here is two-fold. It ensures students are familiar with the
    algorithmic underpinnings of the computational and data systems used for
    Data Science at scale. And it develops good programming skills that are of
    the sort that are commonly tested during technical interviews.
</p>
<p class="hyphenate">
    The third thread in the course is an introduction to what I like to call
    Data Systems. Data Systems organize data for efficient storage and/or
    computation. Relational databases are a canonical example of a Data System.
    As they scale in size, Relational Databases typically rely on
    interconnected computing and storage systems. Issues involving things like
    parallelism and reliability are all conveniently hidden under the hood.
    However, the performance tradeoffs one experiences with using a Relational
    Database are tied to the underlying data structures, algorithms and system
    latencies built into its design. Similar considerations affect all the more
    recent entrants into the Data Systems space, including No-SQL, GPUs and
    cloud computing.
</p>
<p class="hyphenate">
    By the end of the course, students will become comfortable with creating
    and working with end-to-end data science pipelines. They should also feel
    confident in their ability to they can solve programming problems, and be
    able to demonstrate this ability to others. Finally, they should be
    comfortable in working in at least one Data Systems computing environment
    and be able to make knowledgeable comparisons between different Data
    Systems computing environments.
</p>

<h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>

<p class="hyphenate">
    Our intent is that this course provide a welcoming environment for all
    students who satisfy the prerequisites. Our TAs have undergone training in
    diversity and inclusion, and all members of the CS community, including
    faculty and staff, are expected to treat one another in a professional
    manner. If you feel you have not been treated in a professional manner by
    any of the course staff, please contact any of Dan (the instructor), Ugur
    Cetintemel (Dept. Chair), Tom Doeppner (Vice Chair) or Laura Dobler
    (diversity and inclusion staff member). We will take all complaints about
    unprofessional behavior seriously. Your suggestions are encouraged and
    appreciated. Please let Dan know of ways to improve the effectiveness of
    the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.
